This is a stripped-down version of the 'closest' command from CPPTRAJ for
testing purposes.

** To Install **
Run './configure' followed by 'make install'. This will create the
binary 'a.out' in this directory. This binary requires NetCDF. If not
in your system paths, the location can be specified to 'configure' using
'--with-netcdf <dir>'. A full list of configure options can be obtained
with './configure --help'.

** To Test **
The binary can be tested with 'make test'. By default it will look for
the following files:
  tz2.truncoct.parm7: Amber Topology: Trpzip2 (13 residues) in TIP3P solvent.
  tz2.truncoct.nc: Amber NetCDF trajectory, 10 frames.

** To Run **
Command-line options can be obtained by running './a.out --help'.
